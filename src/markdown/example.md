### This is very important.

## It is now possible to write content in Markdown! 

This is faster than having to hardcode specially-formatted HTML.

- You are free
- To type
- Whatever 
- The heck
- __You want!__

*And it will show up here.*

## Awesome!!

(A current limitation of the bundler is that local image paths don't get interpolated when embedded in markdown.)


Also, links are automatically recognized as links (no more redundant specifying `a` tags!)

If you want to [give a link a custom title](https://www.google.com/), you can *still* do that. 

```
// This is a code block.

if (thisIsRenderedCorrectly) {
    itShouldLookPretty(true);
} else {
    console.log('fudgeNuggets');
}
```

`This is some code that should be formatted.`
