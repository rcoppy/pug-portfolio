p Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
| the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
| yellow sun.
| Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles
| is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they stillthink digital watches are a pretty neat idea
| This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: mostof the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of thesewere largely concerned with the movements of small green piecesof paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the smallgreen pieces of paper that were unhappy
| And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, andmost of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches
| Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a bigmistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. Andsome suggested that even the trees had been a bad move, and that noone should ever have left the oceans
| Then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one manhad been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to benice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in asmall cafe in Rickmansworth England suddenly realized what it was thathad been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how theworld could be made a good and happy place. This time it wasright, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed toanything
| Sadly, however, before she could get to a telephone to tell anyoneabout it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the ideawas lost forever
| This is not her story
| But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and someof its consequences
| It is also the story of a book. A book called The Hitch Hiker'sGuide to the Galaxy - not an Earth book, never published onEarth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or evenheard of by any Earthman
| Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book
| It is, perhaps, the most remarkable book ever to come outof the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor - of which noEarthman had ever heard either
| Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highlysuccessful one - more popular than the Celestial Home CareOmnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in ZeroGravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy ofphilosophical blockbusters: Where God Went Wrong, Some More ofGod's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway
| And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer EasterniRim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplantedthe great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository ofall knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions andcontains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate,it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two importantrespects
| First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the wordsDon't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover
| But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of itsextraordinary consequences, and the story of how theseconsequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkablebook begins very simply
| It begins with a house
