        strong On Saturday Morning many beans began flying through trees in the Pumpernickel neighborhood.

        | Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
        | the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
        | yellow sun.
        | Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles
        | is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-
        | descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still
        | think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
        | This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most
        | of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.
        | Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these
        | were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces
        | of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn&apos;t the small
        | green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
        | And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and
        | most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
        | Many were increasingly of the opinion that they&apos;d all made a big
        | mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And
        | some suggested that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no
        | one should ever have left the oceans.
        | Then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man
        | had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be
        | nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a
        | small cafe in Rickmansworth England suddenly realized what it was that
        | had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the
        | world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was
        | right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to
        | anything.
        | Sadly, however, before she could get to a telephone to tell anyone
        | about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea
        | was lost forever.
        | This is not her story.
